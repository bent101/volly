polish

persist scroll positions locally
act on press thing
code line wrap
sticky code block buttons
fix height (isChatting = false initially on navigation, then true after first prompt is sent)

perf

fix rerendering
	should all be part of the prompt, not the response
fix render perf (syntax highlighting, virt scroll)
optimize first load
fix creating lots of chats in a row (+ loading spinners)

3 kinds of convesation branches:
	edits
		persist the active branch; user will probably stick to one, but we should still keep them all
	tangents
		persisted in a right sidebar (like a TOC), and the active one is not persisted (so it can be different between browser tabs)
	ai delegations
		prompt: analyze these 10 resumes
			ai: sure ill blah blah, then creates 10 tangents each with the same parentid as its own, then summarizes

add isTangent and isByAi to prompt
under a response:
	all the prompts that are tangents (in a list, sorted by createdat, open to side)
	all the prompts that arent (show as edits to the prompt with left/right arrows, sorted by createdat, open under)

prompt templates for repetitive self prompts?
	research the current state of \${\["food", "housing", "public transit"]} in \${\["SF", "Seattle", "Irvine"]}.
